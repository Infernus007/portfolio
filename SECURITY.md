# Security Implementation Checklist

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Jash Naik cybersecurity portfolio.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Security Features

### 1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
- Implemented strict CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
- Controlled resource loading from trusted domains only
- Inline scripts and styles properly managed

### 2. **Security Headers**
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS filtering
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information

### 3. **Link Security**
- All external links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- Prevents window.opener attacks and referrer leakage
- Target="_blank" links are properly secured

### 4. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
- Proper handling of user inputs
- Protected against common injection attacks
- Form validation implemented where applicable

### 5. **Accessibility Security**
- Proper ARIA labels prevent screen reader exploitation
- Semantic HTML reduces attack surface
- Focus management prevents keyboard trapping

### 6. **Performance Security**
- Image optimization prevents resource exhaustion
- Lazy loading prevents DDoS through rapid requests
- Bundle optimization reduces attack vectors

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run security audit
npm audit

# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit fix

# Lighthouse security audit
npx lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --only-categories=performance,accessibility,best-practices,seo
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- [ ] Test all input fields for XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify CSP headers are working correctly
- [ ] Check for reflected XSS in URL parameters

#### **Clickjacking**
- [ ] Verify X-Frame-Options header prevents iframe embedding
- [ ] Test iframe protection on all pages

#### **Information Disclosure**
- [ ] Check for sensitive information in client-side code
- [ ] Verify proper error handling doesn't leak information
- [ ] Ensure no debug information in production

#### **HTTPS & Transport Security**
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is enforced in production
- [ ] Check for mixed content issues
- [ ] Validate SSL/TLS configuration

## üöÄ Deployment Security

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Production environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://jash-naik.vercel.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Remove all console.log statements
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in client-side code
- [ ] Check all external links use HTTPS
- [ ] Validate CSP rules don't break functionality
- [ ] Test with ad blockers and security extensions

### Post-deployment Verification
- [ ] Run security headers check: https://securityheaders.com/
- [ ] Perform SSL test: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
- [ ] Validate CSP: https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/
- [ ] Check for mixed content: https://observatory.mozilla.org/

## üîê Ongoing Security Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Update dependencies monthly
- Monitor security advisories
- Review and update CSP rules as needed
- Regular security audits

### Monitoring
- Set up alerts for security vulnerabilities
- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
- Regular penetration testing
- Code security reviews

## üìä Security Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- Zero known security vulnerabilities
- 100% HTTPS coverage
- A+ rating on security headers test
- 95+ Lighthouse security score

### Compliance Standards
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ready

## üõ°Ô∏è Incident Response Plan

### In Case of Security Issue
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Take affected systems offline if necessary
   - Document the incident
   - Notify relevant stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs and system state
   - Identify root cause
   - Assess impact and scope

3. **Remediation**
   - Apply security patches
   - Update affected systems
   - Implement additional safeguards

4. **Recovery**
   - Restore services safely
   - Monitor for residual issues
   - Document lessons learned
